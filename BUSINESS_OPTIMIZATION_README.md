## 🔬 Pattern Discovery

The framework discovers **4 major patterns**:

### Pattern 1: Profit Margin → Valuation
Companies with >15% margins valued **significantly higher** than low-margin companies.

**Evidence:** Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet vs Amazon, Walmart

### Pattern 2: Sector Performance
Different sectors have vastly different baseline success metrics.

**Best performers:** Technology (28% avg margins), Finance (22%)
**Challenging:** Retail (4%), Energy (12%)

### Pattern 3: Scale Advantages
Larger companies show **higher profitability** through economies of scale.

**Evidence:** Top 50% by revenue have higher margins than bottom 50%

### Pattern 4: Luxury Premium
Luxury brands command **2-3x higher margins** than mass market.

**Evidence:** LVMH (21.4%) vs Walmart (2.4%)

## 🎲 Outcome Simulation

For each goal, the framework runs **1000 Monte Carlo simulations** considering:
- Base improvement from optimization (15% avg ± 5%)
- Pattern-based multipliers (from discovered patterns)
- Lever effectiveness (more levers = more options)
- Market conditions (random shocks)

### Success Probability Categories:
- **>75% = SOLVED WELL** ✅ - High confidence, implement immediately
- **50-75% = PARTIALLY SOLVED** ⚡ - Moderate confidence, needs refinement
- **<50% = NOT SOLVED** ❌ - Low confidence, adjust targets or find new levers
